# Making Horchata dairy free no churn ice-cream

##**Horchata**
Horchata de arroz, a rice milk drink most common in Mexico, is flavoured with cinnamon and sugar and drunk cold. To make:
!
90 g of long grain rice
250 ml of coconut milk (liquid at bottom of can of coconut milk).
100 ml of oat milk
Cinnamon (sticks work better, but use 1 tablespoon of powdered cinnamon). 
1 tablespoon Vanilla extract (used 1 5 ml carton of vanilla creamer)
3 teaspoons of sugar (I found this was abit sweet)

Mix rice with coconut milk and blend with hand blender
Add 100 ml of milk and leave rice and milk blend for 3 hours at RT.
Strain rice/milk through mesh or tea stainer and add cinnamon and vanilla and leave O/N in fridge (it should thicken up alot).

## **Ice-cream**
No churn ice-cream avoids the need for eggs for a custard base, and instead uses the aeration of cream and milk to allow ice-crystals to form.
Texture more similar to whey-protein based ice-cream vs standard dairy ice-cream.
250 g of coconut cream (the layer at top of 2 cans, put in fridge O/N to thicken up). *I recommend using the liquid of the can for making Horchata.*
250 ml of vegan half and half or creamer.
250 ml of Horchata (I had 245 ml left over)
20 g of dates (act as a thickener and sweetener)

Whisk up coconut cream and half/half until soft peaks (it was more liquidy for me).
Add dates to 50 ml of horchata mix and blend til paste.
Add data paste and horchata mix to cream and mix until thickens
Freeze O/N

**NOTES: This was just a test. You can replace the coconut cream with condensed milk (you would just scale it up to 435 ml as that's the volume of a can), and you can replace the creamer with heavy cream in a 1:1 ratio.**
